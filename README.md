📊 Customer Churn Analysis
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription and service-based businesses. In this project, I analyzed customer behavior and developed a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving. This helps businesses implement retention strategies, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objectives

Understand key factors influencing customer churn.

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw customer dataset.

Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.

Build and evaluate Machine Learning models to predict churn.

Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Excel (for initial exploration)

Power BI (for dashboard visualization – optional if used)

📂 Dataset

Customer demographics, subscription details, and usage behavior.

Churn labels (Exited / Retained).

Features include: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Tenure, Contract Type, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Customer Status etc.

(Dataset cleaned & anonymized for project use.)

🔍 Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values & duplicates.

Encoding categorical variables.

Feature scaling & transformation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing churn patterns across demographics.

Correlation heatmaps & trend analysis.

Model Development

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost.

Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Results & Insights

Identified key churn drivers (e.g., high monthly charges, contract type).

Built ML model to predict churn with high accuracy.

Recommendations for retention strategies.

📊 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.

Senior citizens and high monthly charge customers are more likely to churn.

Providing loyalty offers and bundled services can reduce churn significantly.
